    We're talking away
    I don't know what I'm to say
    I'll say it anyway
    Today is another day to find you
    Shyin' away
    Oh, I'll be comin' for your love, okay

    ref.:
    Take on me
    (Take on me)
    Take me on
    (Take on me)
    I'll be gone
    In a day or two

    So needless to say
    I'm odds and ends
    But I'll be stumblin' away
    Slowly learnin' that life is okay
    Say after me
    It's no better to be safe than sorry

    ref.:
    Take on me
    (Take on me)
    Take me on
    (Take on me)
    I'll be gone
    In a day or two

    All the things that you say, yeah
    Is it life or just to play my worries away?
    You're all the things I've got to remember
    You're shyin' away
    I'll be comin' for you anyway

    Take on me
    (Take on me)
    Take me on
    (Take on me)
    I'll be gone
    In a day
    (Take on me) x2
    (Take me on)
    (Take on me)

    I'll be gone
    (Take on me)
    In a day
    (Take me on)
    (Take on me) x3
    (Take me on)
    (Take on me)
